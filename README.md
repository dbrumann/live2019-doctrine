Known issues
------------

**Database port is already in use**

You can modify the assigned port by changing the `docker-compose.yaml` or
providing a `docker-compose.override.yaml` that will not be committed with
your remaining changes.

**Using a local database instead of a service**

When using a local database make sure to provide a proper `DATABASE_URL` env var or update the default value in
`.env`. You might also want to adjust the `config/packages/doctrine.yaml` in case you are using a different server
version, e.g. MySQL 5.7 or MariaDB.
